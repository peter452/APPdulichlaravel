Each king, after ascending the throne, came to My Son to perform a holy baptism, offer offerings and build temples. My Son is the only point of Cham art that has a continuous development from the 7th to the 13th century. At the beginning of the 7th century, King Sambhuvarman built the temple with very sustainable materials. at to this day. The later kings all remodeled the old temples and built new temples to offer to their gods.\r\nThe main temples in My Son worship a Linga or the image of Siva - the protector of the Champa kings. The god worshiped in My Son is Bhadrésvara, the king who founded the first king of the Amaravati region in the late 4th century combined with the name Siva, becoming the main religious worship of the god - king and royal ancestors .In 1885, My Son relic was discovered by a French scholar named M.C Paris.

Until the years 1903-1904, the most basic documents about the stele and My Son architectural art were officially published by L.Finot.\r\n\r\nTemple towers in My Son are divided into clusters, built on the same principle. The structure of each cluster consists of a main temple (Kalan), surrounded by small towers or auxiliary structures. The main temple symbolizes Mount Meru - the center of the universe, the place of the gods and the worship of Siva. The auxiliary temples (secondary shrines) worship the gods of heaven. There are also auxiliary buildings, often with tiled roofs, where pilgrims repair and store offerings. Temples of the Cham people do not have windows, only auxiliary buildings have windows.Cham temples and towers are made of bricks and assembled with decorative pieces of sandstone. They are tightly packed and no research has yet identified a binder. After the tower wall was built, the sculptors began to carve flowers, figures, animals ... onto the tower. The technique of Cham sculpting on bricks rarely appears in other art in the area.\r\n\r\nEach temple tower in My Son has 3 main parts: the base of the tower, the base of the tower and the roof of the tower: The base: according to the Champa conception, the base symbolizes the mundane world, usually built on square or rectangular, with large bricks or slate. Around the base are decorated with motifs of patterns, beasts, prayers standing in small arches ...\r\nThe body of the tower: also according to the Champa conception, the body of the tower symbolizes the spiritual world, where people wash away the dust of the world to be able to contact their ancestors and integrate with the gods.\r\nThe roof of the tower: the roof of the tower symbolizes the gods, usually with three stories getting higher and narrower. Each floor fully simulates the structure of the main door and the fake door like the lower floor and is decorated with idols and mounts of the gods in Hinduism such as: god bird, god goose, cow god, elephant, lion. ... The first and second floors at each corner are often decorated with small towers.According to researchers of the ancient Cham tower, the architecture of Cham tower in My Son converges many styles, continuously from the ancient style of the 7th century to the 8th century, the Hoa Lai style of the 8th century to the present. 9th century, Dong Duong style from the middle of the 9th century, My Son style and transition between My Son and Binh Dinh, Binh Dinh style\r\nFor a long time, people still call the temples in My Son in the rhyme A, A ’, B, C, D ... according to the convention of naming and dividing by Henri Parmentier.

To travel to Van village, you can choose one of three ways:\r\n\r\n- The first is by boat: This is the simplest way. Everyone went all the way to Nguyen Tat Thanh, met the bend, then turned towards Highway 1A, went to the place where the people in you asked them and then rented a boat to the village.- The second is from down the mountain: This way takes a lot of energy, you need to have health and passion to overcome. Accordingly, you ride a motorbike to Hai Van Pass. From the foot of the pass up about 2-3 km, you will see a small restaurant on the right, you park there (the price is from 20,000 - 30,000 VND / overnight or not). After that, ask for directions and walk for about 1 km to reach the village.\r\n\r\n- The third is walking through the tunnel: According to Da Nang tourism experience to save time, this is the most preferred route. When you reach the foot of the pass, go up the train line 11 and down the tunnel. The road is about 1 km long, quite dark so it is quite difficult to travel. Remember to ask when the train runs and when traveling close to the edge to avoid danger.

The water here is extremely blue. Usually the boats and canoes will go for 4 to 8 people so you do not bring too much furniture will affect the journey. The canoe gliding quickly on the surface of the water will let you open your eyes to the surrounding of the majestic Hai Van mountain pass, the immense sea, ...\r\n\r\nVan Village Danang - the most ideal camping site\r\nTraveling to Van Da Nang village, young people can choose to camp right next to the beach.
